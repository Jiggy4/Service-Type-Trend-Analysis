# Service Type Trend Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of trends in various healthcare services, focusing on cost and utilization metrics across the U.S. for individuals aged 65 and above. The analysis covers seven major service types, with a particular emphasis on Hospital Outpatient services, which displayed unusual trends over the survey period.

## Objectives
The analysis focuses on identifying unusual trends in the cost and utilization of healthcare services from 2007 to 2021, with a detailed exploration of Hospital Outpatient services and potential factors influencing these trends.

### Key Questions Addressed
1. **Trends in Hospital Outpatient Services:** Examining the significant decline in outpatient visits per 1000 beneficiaries during 2013/2014 and the negligible change in Medicare payment per capita.
2. **Unusual Trends in Other Services:** Identifying and summarizing unusual trends observed in Hospital Inpatient, Imaging, Evaluation and Management, and Tests over the survey period.

## Data Description
  - **Features:** `Year`, `AGE_LVL`, `BENE_GEO_LVL`, `Service_Type`, `Cost`, `Utilization`, etc.
  - **Target Variables:** Cost (Medicare standardized payment) and Utilization (per 1000 beneficiaries).

## Tools Used
- **Excel:** For data analysis and calculation.
- **PowerPoint:** For presenting the findings.
- **Power BI:** For data visualization.

## Methodology
- **Cost and Utilization Analysis:** Analyzed the trends in cost and utilization for seven healthcare service types between 2007 and 2021.
- **Unusual Trends Identification:** Identified unusual trends in Hospital Outpatient, Hospital Inpatient, Imaging, Evaluation and Management, and Tests.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigated potential factors contributing to the observed trends, such as the impact of telehealth and technological advancements.

## Findings
- **Hospital Outpatient Services:** A sharp decrease in utilization by -9.50% during 2013/2014, with a negligible increase in cost (0.71%), possibly due to the growing adoption of telehealth.
- **Hospital Inpatient Services:** Notable decline in cost growth, particularly a 1.9% drop in 2015, and decreased utilization due to a shift towards outpatient care.
- **Imaging Services:** Stable costs with a downward trend in utilization, likely influenced by stricter guidelines and alternative diagnostics.
- **Evaluation and Management (E&M):** Modest cost increase and slight utilization decrease, possibly due to telehealth and more efficient visits.
- **Tests:** Minor cost increases and a slight decline in utilization, indicating better-targeted testing protocols.
- **Technological Impact on Service Delivery:**
  - **Telehealth Adoption:** The widespread adoption of telehealth services since 2001 has significantly reduced hospital and emergency room visits, contributing to the observed trends in service utilization.
  - **VHA Program in Vermont:** A study reported that in Vermont, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) program generated savings of **$63,804 per patient** in 2013 by using home-based telehealth and telemonitoring. These savings were primarily due to the elimination of expenses related to time and travel.
  - **Potential Medicare and Medicaid Impact:** The impact of telehealth, telemonitoring, and telepsychiatry on reducing time, travel expenses, and ER wait times could be mirrored in Medicare and Medicaid services, suggesting a broader potential for cost savings across the healthcare system.

## Practical Applications
- **Healthcare Strategy Development:** Insights from this analysis can guide healthcare providers and policymakers in making informed decisions about healthcare delivery and cost management.
- **Policy Recommendations:**
   - The findings can support public health strategies aimed at optimizing healthcare services and preparing for future trends in service utilization and costs.
   - Develop policies that support the integration of telehealth into standard healthcare practices, ensuring that cost savings are maximized and access to care is improved for patients, particularly those in rural or underserved areas.
- **Estimate Telehealth Impact on Medicare and Medicaid:** Further analysis is recommended to estimate the impact of telehealth adoption on Medicare and Medicaid services, particularly in terms of cost savings and reductions in hospital and ER visits.
- **Promote Telehealth Services:** Encourage the continued adoption and expansion of telehealth, telemonitoring, and telepsychiatry services to further reduce healthcare costs and improve patient convenience.
